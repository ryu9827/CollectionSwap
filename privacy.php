<h2>Privacy policy</h2><br><br>
<p>Collection Swap has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy.<br>
  In this policy we explain how we handle information about you that we gather, store and use.<br>
  In this policy, “Personal Information” means the same as it does in the Privacy Act 1993 (which is: information about an identifiable individual). Other terms that have capital letters in this Privacy Policy but aren't defined here carry the same meaning as in the Terms and Conditions.
</p>
  <h3><strong>1. Use of your information</strong></h3>
  <p>a.	 Collection Swap does not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties. Personal Information is information about an identifiable individual, as defined by the Privacy Act 1993.</p>
  <p>b.	 Collection Swap collects information about you through your use of the Services and the Website, including your registration details and information relating to your use of the Website and the Services, such as the content you access (like listings you have viewed and the search queries you input).</p>
  <p>c.	 Collection Swap uses the information we collect to help us provide the Services to you, to verify your identity, to enforce or apply our terms and conditions, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Collection Swap project group, our users, or others, for internal research purposes, for promoting and marketing other Collection Swap products and Services to you, and for any other use that you authorize.</p>
  <p>d.	 Your membership's collection swap history is published in your feedback if someone places feedback about you.</p>
  <p>e.	 We release Personal Information only when we believe release is appropriate for legal compliance and law enforcement (including to government agencies with statutory law enforcement responsibilities); to facilitate court proceedings; enforce or apply our terms and conditions; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Collection Swap project group, our users, or others. Government agencies with statutory roles enabling them to request data from us include but are not restricted to the Police, Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.</p>
  <p>f.	 You can contact Collection Swap to ask whether your information has been provided, or with any other privacy-related question. Just email us.</p>
  <p>g.	 Where Collection Swap uses third parties to undertake services, we may provide those third parties with some of your information if it is required to fulfil those services. For example, we use third parties to send you letters for address verification, to provide you with shipping services or to conduct research for us to ensure the Services we provide you are relevant and personalized to your interests.</p>
  <p>h.	 If you wish to take Disputes Tribunal (or other) proceedings against another member, you can contact Collection Swap for a statutory declaration form which must be completed before we will consider releasing anyone else's information to you. You may only request contact details for the sole purpose of making a claim.</p>
  <h3><strong>2. Email</strong></h3>
  <p>a.	 It is the policy of Collection Swap to send our members email throughout the swap process and other email they elect to receive, in addition to customary communications (acceptance and rejection confirmations, etc.). Further, it is our policy to immediately remove any member from any mailing list upon the member's request.</p>
 <p>b.	 We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our members, and we encourage you to email us with your questions or comments.</p>
  <h3><strong> 3. User Account registration</strong></h3>
  <p>a.	 Our site's registration form requires you to provide us contact information and may also require demographic information. We may use your contact information from the registration form to send you information about promotional material from some of our affiliated partners. Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary.</p>
  <h3><strong>4. Managing your Personal Information</h3>
  <p>a.	 The Privacy Act gives you the right to access and correct your information. Contact us if you wish to access or update your Personal Information, including changing your email address, password, phone number, etc. When you update your details Collection Swap will store your old details to ensure compliance with our Terms and Conditions - specifically the use of one account per member.</p>
  <p>b.	 If you wish to close your account and delete any Personal Information you have submitted to us, please contact us at privacy@collectionswap.co.nz to make that request. We consider each request for deletion on a case by case basis taking into account our legal obligations to retain certain information.</p>
  <h3><strong>5. Delivery address details</strong></h3>
  <p>a.	 Collection Swap only enables you to save one of your delivery addresses which we will store against your profile. When you swap an item, the delivery address would then send to the seller. We will never give the seller your address without your permission.</p>
  <h3><strong>6. Cookies and local storage</strong></h3>
  <p>a.	 Collection Swap uses various technologies, including cookies and local storage, to collect and store information about you when you visit Collection Swap.</p>
  <p>b.	 Cookies and local storage allow us to store information (including your Personal Information) in a file on the device you use to access Collection Swap. We use cookies and local storage to deliver information and fresh content specific to your interests and to improve the experience of using Collection Swap. Cookies and local storage are widely used.</p>
  <p>c.	 Collection Swap uses "session" cookies to temporarily store information to help you use Collection Swap. This information is used to deliver the right content to you as you use Collection Swap and avoids unnecessarily asking you to log in. Session cookies expire immediately when you close your browser or are deleted after 30 minutes of no activity on Collection Swap.</p>
  <h3><strong>7. Advertising and third-party links</strong></h3>
  <p>a.	 Products and services advertised on Collection Swap are not endorsed by Collection Swap.
    b.	 Some Collection Swap advertisers may request information directly from you, or link to sites that do so. Collection Swap has no control over its advertisers' privacy policies, and you should review such policies prior to submitting any information to them.</p>
  <h3><strong>8. Membership removal</h3>
  <p>a.	 If you wish to have your registration removed from our directory for any reason, you may send us an email requesting this.</p>
  <h3><strong>9. Updates to our information practices</strong></h3>
  <p>a.	 From time to time, we make changes to our information practices or alter the functionality of our website. We will communicate all changes to you by site announcement. Occasionally urgent changes will be required, but we will generally give you at least 2 weeks’ notice to review any changes. From time to time, we may seek your feedback on proposed changes on the NewsLetter board, or, for significant changes notify you directly via email. We always update this statement accordingly, so we encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on privacy practices at Collection Swap.</p>
  <p>b.	 If you have any questions about our privacy policies or any other matter, please contact us.
